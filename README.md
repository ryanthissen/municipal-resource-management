# municipal-resource-management

Municipal Resource Management provides city leaders and citizens with tabular, graphical, and locational information about water and energy usage at city-maintained facilities.  Using this, decisions can be made about which facilities need to increase conservation measures or which should be considered for upgrading existing infrastructure with more efficient models.
